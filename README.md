# brnm-framework
# Plugin BRNM uses to build custom themes
#
# This plugin, upgraded from a directory of files that sit within a theme as of v.2.6.4, is the setup and control functionality BRNM uses on each of its custom-built wordpress themes. It has built in functions for shortcutting thru the dev process, includes show and hide functions for what admins will see, and features that make both the admins' and super user (the developer)'s lives much easier.
